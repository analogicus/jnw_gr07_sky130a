# System description
This is a temperature measurement circuit. It is built up of two blocks:
1. Temp to Current, a circuit that outputs a current proportional to temperature (PTAT)
2. Current to PWM, a circuit that outputs a digital PWM signal proportional to temperature


The system is depicted below

# Temperature to Current, PTAT
**Aka Milestone 1**

The PTAT circuit can be found in "**design/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/temp_to_current.sch**", and is shown
in the figure below. 

![ptat_circuit](/Images/PTAT.png)


The circuit exploits the temperature (T) dependency and size difference (N)
of diode 1 and diode 2 to create a current I(T) dependent on temperature. The voltage over diode 1
is $V_{D1} = V_T ln\frac{I_D}{I_{S1}}$, and the voltage over diode 2 is $V_{D2} = V_T ln\frac{I_D}{I_{S2}}$.
Assuming that the opamp is ideal, the voltage on it's negative input is set equal to it's positive input,
meaning $V_{D1} = V^- = V^+$. This creates a voltage drop accross the resistor $R_1$ of $V_{R_1} = V_{D1} - V_{D2} = V_T ln\frac{I_{S2}}{I_{S1}}$.
Since diode 2 is N times larger than diode 1, we can assume $I_{S2} \approx N I_{S1}$, meaning that $V_{R_1}$ can be simplified to $V_{R_1} \approx V_T ln(N)$.
The current through $R_1$ is then $I_{R_1} = \frac{V_{R_1}}{R_1} = \frac{V_t}{R_1} ln (N)$.
Since $V_T = \frac{kT}{q}$, we get a current proportional to temperature: $I_{R_1}(T) = \frac{kT}{qR_1} ln(N)$. This current is copied using a current mirror,
 creating $I(T)$ and used as an output.

**Note**: The diodes are realized by the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2.

## Testing of the PTAT circuit
To test the circuit follow these steps:
<!-- 
1. enter directory "jnw_gr07_sky130a/sim/temp_to_current_tb"
2. run "make typical". This will sweep the temperature in the range -40 to 130 degrees celcius
3. To see results run "cicsim wave output/tran_SchGtKttTtVt.raw" and plot the current "i(v.xdut.v1)".
-->

1. enter directory "**sim/temperature_to_current_tord/**"
2. run "**make typical**". This will simulate the circuit at temperatures 
from -30 to 130 degrees celcius.
3. The simulations results in the plot seen below. The plot is saves as **plots/ptat_vs_temp_SchGtKttTtVt.png**.

The plots of other yaml files can be seen by running the python file plot_ptat.py with the yaml file(s) location in the folder "output_tran/" as arguments, ex: python plot_ptat.py output_tran/tran_SchGtKttTtVt output_tran/tran_SchGtKffThVl output_tran/tran_SchGtKssThVl output_tran/tran_SchGtKsfThVl output_tran/tran_SchGtKfsThVl.

# Current to PWM
**Aka Milestone 2**

The current to PWM circuit can be found in "**design/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/temp_to_pwm_RA.sch**", and is shown
in the figure below.

![PWM_circuit](/Images/TempToPWM.png)

The circuit used the input current $I(T)$ to charge a capacitor. The voltage across the capacitor is used as input voltage of the positive
node of a comparator, $V^+ = V_C$. The negative node is connected to a reference voltage $V^- = V_{ref}$, created by a voltage divider consisting of two resistors, $R_2$ and $R_3$.
This gives $V^- = V_{ref}= V_{DD} \frac{R_3}{R_3+R_2}$. The voltage across the capacitor can be approximated as $V_C(t) = V^+ = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{I(T)}{C} \ dt \approx \frac{tI(T)}{C}$, assuming that
1. $V_C(t=0) = 0$, the voltage starts at 0 when time is 0.
2. $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0$, the temperature is not dependent on time.

The oputput of the comparator is set to high at time $t_0$, when $V^- = V^+(t_0)$. Using the previous equations this can be written as $V_{ref} = \frac{t_0I(T)}{C}$.
$t_0$ is thus given by $t_0 = \frac{V_{ref}C}{I(t)}$. The output of the comparator is buffered, then fed into a clocked register. The output of the register
is the PWM signal, and is simultaneously used to reset the circuit. The reset is done by discharging the capacitor using an nmos, N1, connected to ground.

It can be shown using previous formulas (found in section "**Temp to Current, PTAT**"), that $\frac{\partial I(T)}{\partial T} > 0$,
meaning that a higher T results in lower $t_0$. This means that higher temperatures results in a PWM signal with higher mean voltage (RMS). This is depicted
the figure below, where temperature $T1 > T0$.

![timing_diagram](/Images/TimingDiagram.png)



## Testing of the PWM circuit

In order to extract $t_0$, the PWM circuit is used to control a 8-bit digital counter during testing. The counter will continously count upwards,
reseting when PWM goes high. The value of the counter when reset is set high is then linearly dependent on temperature. The test circuit is
depicted in the figure below.

![test_setup](/Images/TestCircuit.png)

To run simulations follow
these steps:

1. enter directory /sim/temp_to_pwm_RA
2. type "**make typica**l". This will simulate the circuit using the digital circuit found in "**digital.so**" (compiled using "**digital.v**"),
the testbench in "**tran.spi**", and the "**tran.meas**" file. (**Note** that simulating takes a lot of time since it runs across multiple temperatures!)
3. plot the output using "**plot.py**" => "**python plot.py output_tran/{...}.yaml**"
4. the plot is saved as "**plot.png**", and is depicted below.

Note that the digital output is expressed as a float value, explaining the magnitude of the y-axis. Also, the sudden drop at 120 degrees will be looked into :) (althoug since this is a unique digital
value, it would not cause problems in a digital circuit...)

![pwm_vs_temperature](/sim/temp_to_pwm_RA/plot.png)

**Note**:
1. There also exists a simple testbench, "**design/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/temp_to_pwm_RA_TB.sch**", that can be used for initial simulations of the circuit.
2. The temperature to current block used for the PWM circuit can be found in "**desin/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/temp_to_current.sch**", and is **not** sized identical to the one tested in chapter **Temp to current, PTAT**.

# OTA

The amplifier in the PTAT circuit and the comparator in the PWM circuit is both realized by identical OTA's. The OTA can be found in "**design/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/amplifier.sch**". The OTA is a differential input, single stage transducer. A simple testbench can be found in "**design/JNW_GR07_SKY130A/amplifier_tb.sch**".
